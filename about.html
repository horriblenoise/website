<h1>About</h1>
<p>Alex, AKA <em>HORRIBLENOISE</em> is a cartoonist, comedian, snakehandler, fashion designer, and shrimp breeder living in Toronto.
He has decided to unify all of the above experience into a unique frame of reference (and jumping off point) for digital GAME DESIGN, 
which is why he is rapidly versing himself in the likes of Unity, Git, Html, CSS, C++, and blender. Stay tuned for big things yall.</p>
